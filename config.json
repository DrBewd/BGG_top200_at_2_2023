For the best experience, it is recommended to view this page on computer. When you click on a game\u0027s node, you\u0027ll automatically visualize a subset of the network with some game-specific information.\n\nGames: All games that received at least 1 vote appear here.\n\nModularity class: This defines groups of games clustered together using the Modularity Optimization Algorithm for community detection. The games with a given color tend to be more densly connected to other games of that color.\n\nscore_f: This is the total score reached by the game in this year\u0027s voting. The size of each node is scaled using this value.\n\nEigenvector Centrality: A Measure telling you how well-connected a node is. The closer it is to 1, the more frequently a game appears on lists containing other well-connected games.\n\nConnections: This is a list of games that appeard on a user\u0027s list together with the game that you\u0027re looking at at least 2 times. Please, note that this year there were only 120 voters so this is more of a proof of concept.",
